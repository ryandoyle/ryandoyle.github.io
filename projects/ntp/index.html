<h1>Ryan's Stratum 1 Atomic Clock</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This stratum 1 NTP server is clocked via a Garmin 18LVC. It is one of two publically available stratum 1 located in Australia. It is running on FreeBSD 8.1 using ntpd 4.2.6p2. This is the public implementation of my article, Stratum 1 NTP on FreeBSD 8.0.

<h2>Use it</h2>
<p>
    If you want to use this as a time source, go ahead! You will need to setup your NTP client to point to:
</p>
<pre>ntp.doylenet.net</pre>
<p>For help setting up your operating system to use my NTP server, have a look at the NTP Pool Project documentation. I don't have the server listed on the pool.ntp.org project yet as I don't really want to get inundated with NTP traffic :)</p>
