<h1>Ryan's Stratum 1 Atomic Clock</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>
This stratum 1 NTP server is clocked via a Garmin 18 LVC. It is running on a Raspberry Pi using a ntp 4.2.6.p5, Raspbian, and Linux 3.1.9adafruit-pps kernel</p>

<h2>Use it</h2>
<p>
    If you want to use this as a time source, go ahead! You will need to add the following to your /etc/ntp.conf
</p>
<pre>server ntp.ryandoyle.net</pre>

<p>For help setting up your operating system to use my NTP server, have a look at the NTP Pool Project documentation. I don't have the server listed on the pool.ntp.org project yet as I don't really want to get inundated with NTP traffic :)</p>
